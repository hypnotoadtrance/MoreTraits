description=[h1]IMPORTANT: Build 41.68 and Higher [/h1]
description=Due to false-flags for anti-cheat, it is recommended to disable anti-cheat when hosting a server with this mod. You can try enabling some anti-cheats, but your mileage may vary.

description=[h1]Information: [/h1]
description=This mod adds a great deal more variety to the traits available to players during character creation.
description=
description=This includes, but not limited to: traits that add some starting equipment, traits that increase your starting level in specific skills but don't give exp multiplier, a bunch of unique traits with interesting effects (examples: better weapons proficiencies, better exp gains for specific playstyle, zombie infection immunity with cure period, scavenging perks, driving perks, and so on). Of course, your typical +1/2 in some skills perks are also present.
description=
description=The mod also attempts to add a greater variety of expense, as in there are more -1, -2, -3, -5 traits. This should help prevent the annoying feeling of having one solitary point left with nothing to spend it on.
description=
description=Dynamic Traits submod is present - you can earn/lose traits by leveling skills, list of all available perks can be found [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YM0g4fTXrDiDYuvFvNkmqEjFIaTIK4_Bb0dQvmLnIvA/edit?usp=sharing]here[/url]. Note, that almost everything is configurable through sandbox settings (120 Sandbox options). Want to make only specific perks dynamic? I got you covered,choose which perks you want 1by1. Want to change Skill level requirement to make it easier or harder? No problem, do that. Out of 90+ or so available perks, 50+ can be made dynamic.
