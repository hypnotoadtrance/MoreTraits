description=[h1]To Those Experiencing Issues Connecting to Servers: [/h1]
description=I've been made abundantly aware that some people are unable to join servers. Usually with some return error on the effect of "Checksum Mismatch", "Server has a different version than client", or "File does not exist on server..."

description=To my knowledge, this is not an issue that can be resolved through code - it appears to be some sort of an issue with Steam Workshop downloads.

description=[h1]A Personal Appeal To Decency: [/h1]
description=I frequently receive comments asking for fixes and updates as well as suggestions. Such comments are good as they ensure I've got a little fire under my ass to keep me going, but at the same time, I regularly receive personal messages and friend requests from people within the community either seeking advice for their own work, wishing to contact me to provide assistance with this mod, or just to to talk about bugs and ask for fixes.
description=
description=I respect that many of these personal appeals come from a place of good intention, but I have also received negative experiences from these sources that I frankly care not to deal with.
description=
description=I must ask that people please not randomly add me to their friend's list or drop comments on my profile. I already receive notifications for every comment on this mod, and while I may not respond to each one, I do not want this project bleeding into my personal time.
description=
description=Yes, I know the mod has problems. Yes, I know it can be done better, Yes I know there are people among this community who are both willing and able to help me improve it, but please understand that this project was born out of a passion for the game. It's my project - not anyone else's, and I work on it at my pace.
description=
description=When I made this mod public, I could never have imagined it would receive such attention and while I am grateful, please understand that I work on this mod at my own pace. I have a job, I have responsibilities, I have mental health issues. Sometimes I just can't find the motivation. I'm sorry that I can't update this mod at the rate the community expects, but please respect my privacy. I've had to Private my profile in the past because of this, and I just don't want to have to do that anymore.

description=[h1]Important Note: [/h1]
description=This is my first attempt at modding for Project Zomboid.
description=
description=This mod adds a great deal more variety to the traits available to players during character creation.
description=
description=The most prominent feature so far is the introduction of 1-point-cost traits which give players a minor boon.
description=so far, this includes a series of Prepared traits, which allow users to spend their trait points to give them certain starting items.
description=
description=The mod also attempts to add a greater variety of expense, as in there are more -1, -2, -3, -5 traits. This should help prevent the annoying feeling of having one solitary point left with nothing to spend it on.
description=[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*] Evasive trait sometimes dodges when bandaging/unbandaging wounds.
description=[*] Bouncer trait knocks prone zombies back up.
